				<h4>What is this?</h4>
				<p>Smartphones and Dragons is a 
				<a href="http://learntabletoprpgs.com/tabletop-rpgs-explained/index.html">tabletop RPG</a> 
				that you can play on your smartphone.</p>
				<h4>Why make this?</h4>
				<ol id="whyList">
					<li>It's easy for new players to get started</li>
					<div>Character creation is a guided process. Unlike traditional systems,
					new players can create a character as easily as in a videogame. It is 
					impossible to miss an important step, or to create an invalid character
					by accident.</div>
					<li>Natural to players who are always on their phones</li>
					<div>If you can't beat them, join them! As technology becomes more 
					deeply embedded in our lives, it is becoming harder and harder for GMs
					to say "no tech at the table". For some groups, this is not a good 
					solution, but for others, allowing players a casual interface to the game
					can make all the difference.</div>
					<li>Wiki-style glossary built in to the character sheets</li>
					<div>Everything you need to know about how the game is played is one tap
					away. The glossary function has built-in history, allowing you to dive
					deep into the rules and easily return to where you started.
					</div>
					<li>Everything you need in one place</li>
					<div>If you are in the car, or caught without your character sheets,
					you need not despair. With Smartphones and Dragons, all the material 
					that you need to play is in the palm of your hand.</div>
					<li>No downloads</li>
					<div>This is a web-only application. You will never have to download
					or sign up for anything.</div>
				</ol>
				<h4>Digital? But I Like Rolling Real Dice!</h4>
				<div>Me too. This application is designed so that you always know what dice 
				you need to roll, so that you can use physical dice instead of the built 
				in dice roller.</div>
				<h5>Put your adventuring hat on!</h5>

			<h2 id="introductionH">Introduction</h2>
			No one reads an instruction manual to play Angry Birds. So why should tabletop roleplaying games, which are an extension of the imagination games that we all played as kids, be so hard to learn?

			<br><br>What if the boring parts, the searching for tables and assisting with character creation, were handled for the new players by the computer? 

			<br><br>What if players could create characters in a couple of minutes, instead of a couple of hours? 

			<br><br>What if everyone knew exactly what actions they could take during combat, and were ready when their turn came around?  

			<br><br>What if you could actually harness the power of bored players looking at their smartphones on other players’ turns? 

			<br><br>Well, that is what this rule set and its sibling web-app hope to accomplish.


			<br><br><h2 id="expectationsH">What Should I Expect?</h2>
			This is a tabletop RPG, and it is assumed that the person reading these rules understands the basic concepts of a tabletop RPG.

			<br><br>It is a system that uses a Game Master. 

			<br><br>It is NOT a single-player RPG. 

			<br><br>These rules are designed to take you from character creation through a single session. 

			<br><br>The central idea is that you can play a spontaneous game with fast character creation and quick, tactical combat. 


			<br><br><h2 id="materialsH">What Do I Need To Play?</h2>
			One Smartphone per player
			Wireless Internet access (or cellular data)
			Dice: d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, d4 
			A combat grid, any scale
			Something to represent each PC and enemies (paper clips, miniatures, candy, etc.)

			<br><br><p>You do NOT need:</p>
			To sign up for anything
			To install any apps
			To give out any personal information
			To pay money


			<br><br><h2 id="gettingStartedH">How Do I Get Started? </h2>
			Read the rest of this document. Or just read the Quick Reference and then come back to this document as needed.

			<br><br><h2 id="settingH">The Setting</h2>
			The game takes place in a medieval fantasy world where everyone has magic inside of them. 

			<br><br>Some people use this magic for enhancing their natural abilities. Others use it to create unnatural or impossible feats of arcane trickery. 

			<br><br>The world is filled with strange and magical creatures, whose magic allows then to assume fantastical forms with powerful abilities.

			<br><br>Conflict is ever-present in the world. 

			<br><br>Maybe it is the political turmoil amidst the ruling class of a warring nation,

			<br><br>maybe it is the resurrection of the dread warrior-king Thalamos, 

			<br><br>maybe it is the new Royal Airship Highway to the lands of the eastern airship pirates, 

			<br><br>or maybe it the rise of the Death’s Hand cult under the insane wizard Merlin. 

			<br><br>Whatever the case, there is always a story and a role to play in the great forces that are shaping the world.

			<br><br>The setting is left vague to allow the GM to create the world of their imagination. Do not feel like you need to use this exact setting to play the game. While the player’s moves and abilities are named in a way that evokes high fantasy, the game can be re-skinned to fit many different settings.


			<br><br><h2 id="adventuringH">Adventuring</h2>
			At some point, your character will encounter a challenge in the world that he will have a chance of failing at. 

			<br><br>Whenever there is a dramatic situation, and a character’s success will change the course of events, and there is some chance of failure, the GM will have the player roll a check. 

			<br><br>A check consists of a player rolling a d20 and adding their appropriate skill or attribute to the number rolled.

			<br><br>For a skill check, approximate target numbers (TN) and difficulties  are listed below:


			<br><br>(A target number is the number that you must equal or surpass to earn a success)

			<br><br>Occasionally, you will test an ability instead of a skill. This works the same way.

			<br><br><h2 id="criticalH">Critical!</h2>
			When you roll a 20 on the d20, you keep the 20, pick up the d20 and roll again. Then you add the number that you rolled to the 20, and that is your roll total. If you roll a 20 again, you repeat this process until you roll something other than a 20.
			<h2 id="combatH">Combat</h2>
			Combat in Smartphones and Dragons is conducted in turns. 

			<br><br>Whoever initiates the combat goes first. By that I mean, whichever team (players or GM) says that they want to enter combat is the initiating team. 

			<br><br>If the initiator surprises her opponent, she goes first and starts with her max AP. 

			<br><br>However, if the opponent is expecting an attack, the initiator’s team only starts with half of their max AP.

			<br><br><h2  id="howToAttackH">How to Attack Stuff</h2>
			To attack something, you declare on your turn that you intend to use an ability on it.

			<br><br>In the app, you can press the “use” button of the ability, and it will tell you what you need to roll to succeed (if anything). 

			<br><br>For a basic melee attack, you need to roll your attack (whichever melee weapon you have), and compare the number you roll to your opponent’s defense. If you equal or surpass the defense, then you hit. 

			<br><br>If you are attacking and you successfully hit, then you apply the effect listed in the ability. Often times this will confer a status (see Statuses, below).

			<br><br>If that effect says to roll damage, the number that you roll is indicated by your weapon. 

			<br><br>Your weapon damage should be in red on your character page. 

			<br><br>If the number you roll on weapon damage is higher than your opponent’s Damage Threshold (DT), you confer the Hurt status on them. 

			<br><br>When you deal double a character's DT in damage, you skip past the Hurt Status and incapacitate them immediately.

			<br><br>Depending on the kind of attack, the Hurt status represents a different kind of injury, but in any case, it’s bad news for the receiver.

			<br><br>If a character already had the Hurt status when you rolled higher than their damage threshold, they become incapacitated.

			<br><br><h2 id="abilitiesH">Abilities</h2>
			All attacks are abilities, but not all abilities are attacks.

			<br><br>Whenever you use any ability, you must use the number of Action Points indicated on the ability’s card. AP cost is the number inside the circle. 

			<br><br>If you do not have enough action points, then you cannot use an ability.

			<br><br>Some abilities are special.

			<br><br>Passive abilities (they will have the passive keyword), are always active and require no AP.

			<br><br><h2 id="instantsH">Instants</h2>
			Instant abilities can be used on other player’s turns, but still cost AP. If you don’t have enough AP, you can’t use an instant.

			<br><br>If you use an instant in response to another instant, you create what is called the “stack”. The stack is a term from many games, and what it means is that the last instant is the first one to activate, followed in order back until the first. This does not come up often

			<br><br><h2 id="statusesH">Statuses</h2>
			Statuses are big part of combat in S&D. 

			<br><br>A status represents that a character has some condition, which could be good or bad.

			<br><br>For example, the Burning status indicates that the character is on fire. 


			<br><br><h2 id="statusEffectsH">Glossary of Status Effects </h2>

			<br><br>What does “Save Ends” mean?
			“Save Ends”, means that at the start of your turn you roll a d20. On a 10+, you save: the status is now gone.

			<br><br><h3>Marked:</h3>
			Someone has marked you as a target. This status has no other effect. Save Ends. 

			<br><br><h3>Incapacitated:</h3>
			You are either dead or unconscious. Either way, you can’t do anything.

			<br><br><h3>Prone: </h3>
			You cannot use the move ability. You take a -1 penalty to defense while Prone. You can remove the prone status on your turn for the cost of 2 move actions (if you have heavy armor this will cost more than 2 AP).

			<br><br><h3>Immobilized: </h3>
			You cannot use the move ability. Save Ends.

			<br><br><h3>Grappled: </h3>
			You cannot use any ability except a standard attack at -2 or break free (strength test against grappler) for 4 AP.

			<br><br><h3>Frozen / Paralyzed: </h3>
			You cannot take any action. Save Ends.

			<br><br><h3>Poisoned / Burning / Blighted: 	</h3>
			Your Damage Threshold is lowered by X (where x is specific to source of this status). Save Ends.

			<br><br><h3>Weakened: 	</h3>
			When rolling, roll twice and take the lower result. Save Ends.

			<br><br><h3>Frightened: </h3>	
			You cannot move towards the source. Save Ends.

			<br><br><h3>Slowed: </h3>
			Movement costs an additional AP. Save Ends.

			<br><br><h3>Exhausted: 	</h3>
			Receive half max AP (rounded up)
			
			<br><br><h3>Aura: </h3>
			Different Aura effects have different benefits, but you can only have one Aura type status at any time.

			<br><br><h2 id="combatExampleH">Combat Example: Slayer vs. Orc</h2>
			<span style="font-style: italic;">
			<br><br><h3>Turn 1 - Slayer</h3>

			<br><br>I (Slayer) attack the orc. We are pretty well matched.

			<br><br>I initiated the battle and so I go first.

			<br><br>Because this is the very first turn, I start with half of my maximum of 10 Action Points (AP). 

			<br><br>Ordinarily, all characters have a maximum of 10 AP, which they replenish at the END of their turn.

			<br><br>I look at the moves available to me as a Slayer, and decide that I want to do a Melee Attack. 

			<br><br>A Melee Attack costs four AP, which I have. 

			<br><br>Once I use it, it is pretty much all I can do, since I only have 5 AP this turn. 

			<br><br>When I use Melee Attack, I subtract the 4 AP that it costs, leaving me with 1 AP.

			<br><br>I roll a twenty sided die (d20) and add the melee skill I will be using (Two-Handed Weapons). I compare the result against the Orc’s Defense (16).

			<br><br>I roll a 7, plus my Two-Handed Weapons of 9 gives me 16, which just barely beats the orc’s defense of 16, so I successfully hit. 

			<br><br>To defeat the orc that I hit, I roll damage. To find out how much damage I do to the Orc, I look at my weapon’s damage. 

			<br><br>In this case, my weapon's description says that it deals 1d10 + Strength (my Strength is a 3)

			<br><br>Now I roll, but unfortunately, I roll a 1, leaving my damage at 4. This does not overcome the Orc's Damage Threshold of 9 so I am unsuccessful in hurting it.

			<br><br>The GM narrates how the Orc laughs at the weak, little cuts that my sword opens.

			<br><br>Since it is the end of my turn, I replenish my AP. 

			<br><br><h3>Turn 1 - Orc</h3>

			<br><br>Now it is the Orc's turn.

			<br><br>The Orc moves back and throws a boulder at me. To accomplish this, the GM rolls a d20 and adds the Orc's Throwing Weapons skill. 

			<br><br>To determine what number it needs to successfully hit, the GM looks on the appropriate range table. She discovers that to hit a normal target at short range with a cumbersome projectile will take a 15 or higher. She rolls a 17, so that hits.

			<br><br>She rolls for damage. The Boulder deals 1d4 + 2 * Strength damage. The orc has a Strength of 5, so even though she rolls a 1, that's still way over my Damage Threshold of 6. Ouch!

			<br><br>When my character is hit with an attack that deals greater than his Damage Threshold of damage, it means that he cannot withstand that amount of damage and keep on fighting.

			<br><br>To reflect this, a character who is damaged above their DT gains the Hurt status.

			<br><br>When a character is Hurt, they can defend, and use their basic move but they cannot do anything else. 

			<br><br>The only way to keep fighting is through sheer willpower, or Spirit.

			<br><br>In order to remove the Hurt status, I have to roll Spirit at the start of my turn:
			- If I get less than a 10, I remain Hurt and cannot try to remove the status again until the start of my next turn. 
			- If I got less than a 20, I can remove the status by spending 20 minus my roll's worth of AP. For example, if I rolled an 11, I would have to spend 9 AP to remove the status. 
			- If I roll 20 or over, I can remove the status and then take my turn normally.

			<br><br>Being hurt is very bad because it leaves you vulnerable: If an attack overcomes your DT while you have the Hurt status, instead of getting the Hurt status again, you are incapacitated / out of the fight for good!

			<br><br><h3>Turn 2 - Slayer</h3>

			<br><br>I roll Spirit and I get a 19 total. I spend the 1 AP to remove the Hurt status and then I use Leaping Chop, which doubles my damage on a successful hit.

			<br><br>Let's say that I successfully hit.

			<br><br>Whatever the resulting damage is, I double it because of Leaping Chop.

			<br><br>This time, when I roll for damage (using the same weapon) I roll a 9, for a total of 24 damage! ( (9+3)*2 ) 

			<br><br>That is more than enough to overcome the Orc's DT. 

			<br><br>Not only does it overcome the Orc's DT, but it deals more than 2 times the Orc's DT, which means that I incapacitate the Orc with one hit. (When you deal double a character's DT, you skip past the Hurt Status and incapacitate them directly)

			<br><br>The GM gives me permission to describe the killing blow, so I tell the group, "The Slayer arcs his trained blade down through the Orc's chest, and the Orc falls with a mighty thud upon the cracked earth."
