A die with six sides is a d6. A die with 20 sides is a d20. Etc. When you are asked to roll one of these dice, you use the number of the side that lands face-up as the value of your roll. (Note for if you are using physical dice: The d10 is a little unusual because the die commonly has a zero on one side. For the purposes of this game, that zero always has a value of 10. The d4 is also a little strange because it has no upward face. The way you tell what you rolled is by looking at the number that is right-side-up)"
