    "Procrastinating does nothing more than add to your do list. Do it, be done with it!",

    "I have met hundreds of people who have made putting off today what can be done tomorrow a science.",

    "Procrastination is the grave in which opportunity is buried. ",

    "So what do we do? Anything. Something. So long as we just don't sit there. If we screw it up, start over. Try something else. If we wait until we've satisfied all the uncertainties, it may be too late.",

    "The habit of always putting off an experience until you can afford it, or until the time is right, or until you know how to do it is one of the greatest burglars of joy. Be deliberate, but once you've made up your mind -jump in.",

    "We shall never have more time. We have, and have always had, all the time there is. No object is served in waiting until next week or even until tomorrow. Keep going day in and day out. Concentrate on something useful. Having decided to achieve a task, achieve it at all costs.",

    "You may delay, but time will not. ",

    "In a moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing to do. The worst thing you can do is nothing.",

    "The greatest amount of wasted time is the time not getting started.",

    "Procrastination is the thief of time.",

    "Procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday.",

    "You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.",

    "If and When were planted, and Nothing grew.",

    "Procrastination is the fear of success. People procrastinate because they are afraid of the success that they know will result if they move ahead now. Because success is heavy, carries a responsibility with it, it is much easier to procrastinate and live on the 'someday I'll' philosophy.",

    "Doing just a little bit during the time we have available puts you that much further ahead than if you took no action at all. ",

    "Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.",

    "Don't wait for someone to take you under their wing. Find a good wing and climb up underneath it.",

    "Do you know what happens when you give a procrastinator a good idea? Nothing!",

    "Putting off an easy thing makes it hard, and putting off a hard one makes it impossible.",

    "A year from now you may wish you had started today.",

    "The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."
