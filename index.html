            side of features such as Contests and Portal Lords. I also built the
            first chat "sticker" system, allowing players to use unique,
            unlockable emojis in the chat.
            More generally speaking, I would categorize the tasks I was responsible for as:
            Player-Facing Bug Fixes, UI Improvements, Creating New UI, and Polishing the Experience.

            The client uses a combination of plain ES6 for the canvas,
            and React.js for the UI. The iOS client was built based off of a Ray Wenderlich
            tutorial, but otherwise is a ground-up native Swift application that also
            uses websockets. The chat server is also the provider for the APNs (Apple Push Notifications).

                demonstration of autonomous agent behaviors. Press SPACE when viewing to switch to the more cinematic views.
                The agents (the characters) act on
                weighted criteria: their actions are not pre-determined.
                The small
            character's strongest impulse is to put some obstacle between the big character and itself (to hide). This is
            advantageous because if they leave the big character's
            line of sight, it starts looking for a new target. See if you can figure out all of the behaviors!
            You can find a comprehensive rundown

				<p id="FTDesc" class="description">Along with the very talented designer <a href='http://vimeo.com/marazan'>Adam Marazan</a>, I created this financial timeline applet for eMoney Advisor.
				The idea behind the timeline is that you can interactively explore
				the market data in ways that come alive much more than a textbook.
				Double-click a decade to zoom in on that decade, and use the back
				button in the decade-view to return to the full view. If you drag
				the timeline cursor to the edge of the screen and release it in the
				decade view, the graph will shift five years that direction. </p>
