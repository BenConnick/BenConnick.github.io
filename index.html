					CatStack is an upcoming room-scale VR game about a cat daycare

					This project is my VR baby. I am responsible for all of the scripting, game design, level design, 
					gameplay, QA, systems, and putting it all together. I chose Unity because the VR support through the SteamVR 
					plugin was strong at the start of the project. 3d models are mostly from Suriyun and Area730, with a few I made in blender. 
					Music is by Kevin Macleod.

					A game made for the 2016 Global Game Jam. The theme was "Ritual". We applied 
					the theme by humorously suggesting that since computers run on black magic,
					it would make since that inside your computer are entities completing
					complex rituals to make things run without crashing. In the game, these
					rituals consist of dodging obstacles and remembering an increasingly long 
					sequence of "simon says" style chants. <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/smashthestack">Link to the Game Jam Page</a>

				<p class="description">
					Whisper of a Lullaby is a dark and whimsical third-person adventure game in which a 6-year old child, known as Dusk, finds himself in a world of other children’s dreams. Using powers he gains from his new friends, he must help them overcome their nightmares so they can wake up in the real world.

					My Role:

				<p>
					I am currently one of the two gameplay programmers on the project. 
					Previously the project had more developers on board, and at that time
					I was also responsible for giving weekly updates to our creative director,
					and distributing tasks to the other developers. I built a multitude of small systems
					such as key management, playtesting controls, character transformations, and 
					NPC behaviors. The majority of the game was built in Unreal Engine over the course of two-months.
					The rest is being built now by the remaining passionate students who want to
					bring this game to market.

                The small 
            character's strongest impulse is to put some obstacle between the big character and itself (to hide). This is
