                <p>The Legend of the Sword and Fairy is a Taiwanese role playing 
                    game released in 1995. When Journey creative director 
                    <a href="http://thatgamecompany.com/company/people/jenova-chen/">Jenova Chen</a> 
                    played it, at the age of fourteen, it was the first 
                    piece of media to move him to tears. He says, in a 2012 
                    interview with Eurogamer, “I decided that I wanted to 
                    dedicate my life to helping others experience what I had 
                    just felt”. For many people, Journey has done just that.</p>
                <p>Chen often references a letter he received from a 15 
                    year old girl. In brief, the letter explains that Journey 
                    changed her life, because it was the last game that she had 
                    played with her father before he died. She says that the 
                    game brought her joy in a time of grief, and helped her to 
                    understand her father’s own journey.</p> 
                <p>Journey has a powerful, resonant theme. The ability of a 
                    player to apply the metaphor of the Journey to their real 
                    experiences makes it a game that surpasses all cookie-cutter shooters and 
                    similarly shallow experiences. But that is not Chen’s 
                    concern here. </p>
                <p>What Chen is talking about here is the fact 
                    that, whatever purpose shooters serve, it has been well 
                    filled, and inspiring experiences like Journey are far too 
                    few.</p>
