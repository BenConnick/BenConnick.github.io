                <p>Journey was, in many ways, a game-changer for the industry 
                    (pun intended). For example, efforts to facilitate easy 
                    communication in games are thought to increase player 
                    interaction, but the decision not to include chat 
                    functionality during the game actually brought people much 
                    closer. What Journey did was more significant than just 
                    break many of the deeply established conventions of the 
                    industry. The game was a testament to the possibilities of 
                    the medium. Journey won Game of the Year at D.I.C.E, IGN, 
                    and Gamespot, as well as dozens of other awards. This 
                    fourteen person studio showed the world that there is so 
                    much potential in games as a medium. </p>
                <p>Perhaps Journeyâ€™s greatest accomplishment is not a part of 
                    the game, but rather, that it was able to open up the minds 
                    of publishers, designers, and consumers about the 
                    possibilities still remaining.</p>
