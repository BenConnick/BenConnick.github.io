                <p>The above quote comes from a 2012 interview with Journey's creative director,
                    <a href="http://thatgamecompany.com/company/people/jenova-chen/">Jenova Chen</a>.
                    Journey is revered by many game enthusiasts because it 
                    provides something that is greatly lacking among other games. 
                    Here, Chen is explaining what that something is. The 
                    implication of this quote is that games aren't living up to 
                    their potential. Often, when describing the different kinds 
                    of experiences that games can provide, an analogy will be 
                    drawn between blockbuster movies watched for entertainment, 
                    and movies that are watched to provoke thought.</p> 
                <p>Chen argues that adults are interested in more than simple 
                    entertainment. I interpret his use of the word "enjoy" here to 
                    imply that the experience has an lasting impact. I think what is 
                    interesting about his assertion, is that while it would seem to 
                    preclude games like Candy Crush, and Call of Duty, the 
                    experience of those games goes beyond the game itself, because 
                    of the social interactions that those games enable. The depth 
                    of a game like Candy Crush comes, arguably, from the 
                    interactions of its players outside of the game itself. </p>
                <p>In Journey, much of the depth arises from the way that conventional 
                    clutter was stripped away to make the game a story about one or 
                    two people. In addition, the atmosphere and soundtrack of 
                    Journey allow it to produce what Chen calls here the "goosebumps" 
                    of depth. The music of Austin Wintory, along with the stunning 
                    visuals, set each chapter's mood perfectly, connecting the 
                    player deeply into an immersive experience. Because of all 
                    of this, a player can 
                    become fully absorbed into their discovery, as they explore a 
                    world that is at once alien and immediate.</p>
