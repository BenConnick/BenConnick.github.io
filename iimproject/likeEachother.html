                <p>At D.I.C.E. 2013, 
                    <a href="http://thatgamecompany.com/company/people/jenova-chen/">Jenova Chen</a>
                    explained the challenges of 
                    designing a game where the experience relied on players - 
                    total strangers - liking each other. It was a goal that some 
                    would say contrasts with human nature. Chen disagrees. He 
                    believes that players are not fundamentally bad, but it is 
                    the games that make them behave badly. He argues that 
                    players seek out meaningful interactions, and oftentimes, 
                    the most meaningful thing a player can do 
                    is to exercise their power over another player. </p>
                    <p>The experience of Journey relies on players never harming 
                    each other's immersion. Because of this,
                    some very unusual design decisions were made.
                    For one thing, player avatars do 
                    not display any kind of name, nor is there any sort of 
                    leaderboard or menu where the player can find the identity 
                    of the person they were playing with. In order to maintain 
                    this complete anonymity, players are prevented from inviting 
                    their friends or knowing which game they are joining. 
                    <p>No 
                    chat functions were included in the game, and the main 
                    method of communication provided was through “chirps” 
                    (sounds the player can make, which resemble the whistle of a 
                    flute), which were carefully crafted so that they could not 
                    be “spammed” or used offensively. Obviously, removing the 
                    typical channels of communication prevented players from 
                    using offensive language, but it also prevented them from 
                    breaking the immersion, as the entire game features no 
                    symbolic “language” in the usual sense. 
                    (the glyphs have little to no symbolic significance to 
                    players, and cannot be employed by players to communicate). </p>
                    <p>
                    A seemingly minor decision was to completely remove player 
                    collisions. There is no way for the players to harmfully 
                    trap or push each other. Anyone who has played a game where 
                    player collisions are abused will realize that this is a 
                    huge part of maintaining the peace between players. Another 
                    decision that Chen speaks about was the choice to make 
                    collectibles appear to each player individually, so that one 
                    player cannot prevent another from collecting resources. 
                    Originally, the experience was intended to include four 
                    players, but Journey’s designers reduced this to two in 
                    order to create a greater connection between the two 
                    travelers, otherwise alone in the desert. </p>
                    <p> Making the players 
                    important to each other was another hurdle that the 
                    designers overcame by making players and other “animals” in 
                    the game increase each other’s “charge” or “power” when in 
                    proximity. In addition, the player’s “chirps” also “charge” 
                    other players. This means that the actions typical of other 
                    games, like swinging a sword or shooting a gun, are replaced 
                    with helping actions, but they are still equally interesting 
                    to the actor and the target. 
                    <p>To highlight this mechanics principle, the designers
                    made the character without arms. A 
                    character without arms is not expected to be able to hit, 
                    restrain, or molest another. </p>
                    <p> By upholding design with theme, the experience is cohesive
                    and unforgettable. Journey achieves the emotion Chen intended.</p>
