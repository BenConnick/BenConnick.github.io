<h2>What is this</h2>
<p>
    This is an interactive-story building tool, like "Twine".
</p>
<h2>How to make a link</h2>
<p>
    To link passages together, use the following syntax: <br/>
    <a href>[[display text|passage title]]</a> or <a href>[[passage title]]</a><br/><br/> 
    For example, writing <span style="opacity: 70%">"Make your choice! [[red]] [[blue]] [[green]]"</span> 
    will link to three different passages titled "red", "blue" and "green".<br/><br/> 
    However if you want to use a different text, for example
    <span style="opacity: 70%">"Push the DOOM button? [[push|bad ending]] [[don't|bad ending]]"</span> 
    you can display link text that does not match title of the passage that will be linked.
</p>
